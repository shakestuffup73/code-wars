<h1>Javascript Coding Practice from CodeWars, LeetCode and Discord</h1>
<h4><i>This will be a workspace to practice Javascript coding challenges. I'll include the original word problem prompt as well as my solution(s) for having solved them.</i></h4>
<h4>Challenge Problem 1: Factorial Using Recursion</h4>
<h5>
function factorial(){
  <br>
    // This function returns the factorial of a given number.
  <br>
    // You must set the parameters of the function yourself
  <br>
    //  The input will be a positive integer greater than zero
  <br>
}
<br>

<h4>Challenge Problem 2: Who Likes It?</h4>
<h5>
You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.
<br>
<br>
Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:
<br>
<br>

[] -->  "no one likes this"
["Peter"] -->  "Peter likes this"
<br>
["Jacob", "Alex"] -->  "Jacob and Alex like this"
<br>
["Max", "John", "Mark"] -->  "Max, John and Mark like this"
<br>
["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"] -->  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"

<h4>Challenge Problem 3: Jaden Casing Strings</h4>
<h5>
Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.
<br>
<br>
Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.
<br>
<br>
Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"

<h4>Challenge Problem 4: Return Vowel-Count</h4>
<h5>Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.</h5>

<h4>Challenge Problem 5: Sort the Odd</h4>
<h5>You will be given an array of numbers. You have to sort the odd numbers in ascending order while leaving the even numbers at their original positions.</h5>
<br>
<br>
[7, 1]  =>  [1, 7]
[5, 8, 6, 3, 4]  =>  [3, 8, 6, 5, 4]
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]  =>  [1, 8, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2, 9, 0]

<h4>Challenge Problem 6: Square Every Digit</h4>
<h5>In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them. For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.
<br>
<br>
Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer
